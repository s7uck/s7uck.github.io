	<h2 class="title">Laptop(s)</h2>
	<p>My laptop is an Acer Aspire 5 51G from 2017. It's not really a laptop anymore since the screen broke and I have to use it with an external monitor and keyboard all the time. Specs wise it's not bad, but the spinny disk really throttles it.</p>

	<p>Recently I also got my hands on a rare <strong>Olivetti P35</strong> laptop from 2011 that originally had Windows 7 on it and now runs Windows 10. Unlike my dad's <strong>Olivetti S1500</strong>, this one is 64-bit and rocks a 2nd gen i3 rather than a 1st gen. I'm planning to do a disk swap to install a SATA SSD and maybe use it as my own for a while. Currently using it off my live usb switching between Kubuntu and Lubuntu.</p>

		<p>The <strong>Lumix FZ-82</strong> has been my main camera since 2017 and it allowed me to get into professional photography. It's only a bridge camera, but it is still a very capable little machine. Also fun fact: it was the first thing I bought with my own allowance money, at 300€!</p>
